# Asteroids
Nodejs web api which in turn queries a NASA asteroid API

The NASA API works for a limited amount of time on the same ip address / day.  
If you are going to go beyond 50 requests per day you should request an API key to allow for more daily queries.

Setup:
In order to get the app to run you will need to run npm i on the command line housing the project 
in order to pull down the required libraries.
